# flashbackz implementation plan

The sibling flashback-re plan owns research. Exact fidelity and maintainability are independent
gates. All runtime work uses the original as the reference; no approximate acceptance stage.

- [x] **00 — Independent architecture review** — Depends: reference survey.
  - Design scene lifecycles, actor state, movement/collision, inventory, world behaviors, content,
    rendering and audio for readability and extensibility; original code boundaries are no guide
    to modern module/API boundaries (user clarification, 2026-10-03).
  - Gate: a concrete design explains ownership and extension points, demonstrates adding a room
    and actor behavior, and avoids translated machine state or legacy instruction dispatch in
    the engine. Review this independently of all fidelity comparisons.

- [ ] **01 — Platform foundation and initial architecture** — Depends: 00.
  - Adapt the template's Zig skeleton and establish typed game/content boundaries, with no
    multiplayer. Write the initial design from measured Flashback requirements.
  - Gate: standalone synthetic build, tests, smoke, no-SDL headless verification and browser
    checks pass; placeholder output is explicitly labeled; toolchain versions are recorded.
- [ ] **02 — Content sources and compatibility parsers** — Depends: 01, research 06.
  - Read the user's original CD or extracted directory into named, validated content; keep
    source layout and legacy scripting semantics at the compatibility boundary.
  - Gate: synthetic malformed-input cases pass; decoders agree with independent original
    observations; game code consumes typed content rather than executable addresses.
- [ ] **02a — Direct disc-image argument** — Depends: 01.
  - Both native hosts accept an ISO or supplied MODE1/2352 BIN image in the existing positional
    asset argument, reading files directly through the same asset contract as a directory.
  - Gate: synthetic image and malformed-input tests pass; all original files read from the
    image match the inventory, and Linux/Windows hosts build without extraction dependencies.
- [ ] **03 — Exact first playable room** — Depends: 02, research 05 and 07.
  - Scene flow, input, Conrad, collision, animation, inventory, drawing and sound through the
    shared simulation and the SDL/agent hosts.
  - Gate: exact state/events/timing/frame/audio comparisons pass, and the SDL build is played
    using real input; implementation review confirms readable game concepts and bounded work.
- [ ] **04 — Whole local game** — Depends: 03, research 08 and 09.
  - All levels, difficulties, enemy and puzzle behaviors, menus, demos, cinematics, languages,
    sound modes, checkpoints/passwords and configuration.
  - Gate: exact behavior coverage is complete and the user can play the game through.
  - Audio acceptance uses AdLib FM plus game-supplied PCM; MT-32 emulation is not required
    (user decision, 2026-10-03). Reuse only generic chip code after review, with its tests and
    attribution; Flashback's audio engine is independently designed and verified.
- [ ] **05 — Target acceptance** — Depends: 04.
  - Linux, Windows and browser packaging, inputs, audio, storage, lifecycle and long sessions.
  - Gate: Linux runtime acceptance and a successful Windows cross-build suffice for Windows
    (user decision, 2026-10-03); browser acceptance still includes actual browser execution.
- [ ] **S1 — Standalone builds and tests** — Depends: none.
  - Gate, repeated at each phase: clean checkout builds and tests without game files, research
    tools or sibling repositories; no proprietary content enters version control.
